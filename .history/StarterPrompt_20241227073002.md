= SPEC: LLM-Pack
:sectnums:
:toc:

== Background

As developers and LLM users increasingly rely on generative AI tools to assist in development, creating concise, comprehensive, and contextually rich data inputs becomes critical. Many large language models (LLMs) operate in environments where users cannot upload large datasets or numerous files directly. Instead, users must copy and paste relevant content manually, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and often results in loss of critical context.

LLM-Pack is a CLI tool, with an optional GUI launched from the CLI, designed to address this challenge. It optimizes project files and datasets for consumption by LLMs and humans alike. By consolidating content into a single, labeled, and sorted file with metadata and interconnectivity details, LLM-Pack streamlines workflows, enhances LLM responses, and saves time for developers.

The tool respects existing project structure by adhering to ignore files, applies user-configured settings via `.llm-pack.config.json`, and outputs a `.llm-pack` folder with generated files and configurations. Its API-first design ensures high extendability and integrability across various platforms, fostering a robust ecosystem around the tool.

== Requirements

The LLM-Pack application must meet the following requirements to address the identified user needs effectively:

=== Must-Have

- **Recursive Indexing**: The tool must scan the entire project/dataset folder structure recursively, identifying all files and folders.
- **Ignore File Compliance**: Respect ignore files (`.gitignore`, `.llm-pack.ignore`, etc.) in the root or child directories during indexing.
- **File Consolidation**: Combine all non-ignored files into a single output file with:
  - Stylized headers containing file name, relative path, and metadata.
  - Relevant interconnectivity details for LLM optimization.
- **Sorting Mechanism**: Sort files in a manner optimized for both LLMs and humans.
- **Config File Support**: Parse `.llm-pack.config.json` files to customize the behavior and settings of the tool.
- **.llm-pack Folder Generation**: Output the consolidated file and associated configurations to the `.llm-pack` folder in the root directory.
- **CLI with Optional GUI**: Provide a command-line interface with an optional GUI for ease of use.
- **Extendable API**: Include a comprehensive API that allows easy integration with other systems or applications.
- **Security Compliance**: Ensure that sensitive data is handled securely and that the tool does not expose or leak confidential information.
- **Performance Efficiency**: Optimize the tool to handle large projects with minimal memory and CPU usage.

=== Should-Have

- **Metadata Enrichment**: Automatically generate additional metadata for files, such as descriptions or relationships, where applicable.
- **Interactive Mode**: Offer an interactive CLI mode for advanced configuration during execution.
- **Error Handling and Reporting**: Include robust error detection, logging, and user-friendly reporting.
- **Internationalization (i18n)**: Support multiple languages for the GUI and CLI to cater to a global user base.

=== Could-Have

- **Content Analysis**: Analyze file content for additional sorting and organization strategies (e.g., detecting similar themes or topics).
- **Language Agnostic**: Ensure compatibility with any file or folder structure regardless of content type or language.
- **GUI Customizations**: Allow GUI users to modify settings visually before execution.
- **Plugin System**: Enable third-party plugins to extend the functionality of LLM-Pack.

=== Won’t-Have (for MVP)

- **Cloud Integration**: Direct integration with cloud services (e.g., S3, GDrive) is deferred for future versions.
- **Real-Time Syncing**: Automatic syncing with external datasets or repositories is out of scope for the initial implementation.
- **Workers and Web Workers**: Worker threads, including Web Workers for concurrency, will not be supported in the MVP version.

= LLM-Pack Standards
:sectnums:
:toc:

== Introduction

This document outlines the **LLM-Pack Standards**, which provide explicit guidelines for coding, documentation, styling, and other development practices essential for the consistent and high-quality development of the LLM-Pack application. Adhering to these standards ensures code readability, maintainability, and facilitates collaboration among all contributors.

== Code Standards

Maintaining high-quality code is crucial for the scalability and maintainability of LLM-Pack. The following standards must be strictly followed by all contributors.

=== Programming Language and Environment

- **Language**: JavaScript (ES6+) with Node.js as the runtime environment.
- **Node.js Version**: 16.x or higher.
- **Package Manager**: npm (version 7.x or higher).

=== Naming Conventions

Consistent naming conventions enhance code readability and maintainability.

- **Variables and Functions**:
  - Use `camelCase` for variable and function names.
    ```javascript
    // Good
    const fileScanner = new FileScanner();
    function getMetadata() { /* ... */ }

    // Bad
    const File_Scanner = new FileScanner();
    function Get_Metadata() { /* ... */ }
    ```

- **Classes and Constructors**:
  - Use `PascalCase` for class names.
    ```javascript
    // Good
    class FileScanner { /* ... */ }

    // Bad
    class fileScanner { /* ... */ }
    ```

- **Constants**:
  - Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.
    ```javascript
    // Good
    const MAX_RETRIES = 5;

    // Bad
    const maxRetries = 5;
    ```

- **Files and Directories**:
  - Use `kebab-case` for file and directory names.
    ```
    // Good
    file-scanner.js
    metadata-processor.js

    // Bad
    FileScanner.js
    metadataProcessor.js
    ```

=== Code Organization

Promote modularity and separation of concerns by organizing code effectively.

- **Modules**:
  - Each module should reside in its own file within the `src/` directory.
  - Modules should export a single responsibility to facilitate testing and reuse.
    ```javascript
    // file-scanner.js
    class FileScanner {
      constructor(rootDir) { /* ... */ }
      async scan() { /* ... */ }
    }

    module.exports = FileScanner;
    ```

- **Directory Structure**:
  - Follow the structure outlined in the [Design Specification](./design-spec.md).
    ```
    src/
    ├── cli/
    ├── core/
    ├── gui/
    ├── api/
    ├── output/
    ├── utils/
    └── tests/
    ```

=== Modularity

- **Single Responsibility Principle**:
  - Each module should have one, and only one, reason to change.

- **Encapsulation**:
  - Keep internal module details private.
  - Expose only necessary interfaces.
    ```javascript
    // Good
    class MetadataProcessor {
      constructor() { /* ... */ }
      async enrich(file) { /* ... */ }
    }

    module.exports = MetadataProcessor;
    ```

    ```javascript
    // Bad
    class MetadataProcessor {
      constructor() { /* ... */ }
      async enrich(file) { /* ... */ }
      _privateMethod() { /* ... */ }
    }

    module.exports = MetadataProcessor;
    ```

=== Error Handling

- **Try-Catch Blocks**:
  - Use `try-catch` blocks to handle synchronous and asynchronous errors.
    ```javascript
    async function processFile(file) {
      try {
        const data = await readFile(file);
        // Process data
      } catch (error) {
        logger.error(`Error processing file ${file}: ${error.message}`);
        throw new FileProcessingError(`Failed to process ${file}`);
      }
    }
    ```

- **Error Messages**:
  - Provide clear and descriptive error messages.
    ```javascript
    // Good
    throw new Error('Invalid configuration: Missing "rootDir" property.');

    // Bad
    throw new Error('Config error.');
    ```

- **Custom Errors**:
  - Create custom error classes for specific error types.
    ```javascript
    // file: errors/FileScannerError.js
    class FileScannerError extends Error {
      constructor(message) {
        super(message);
        this.name = 'FileScannerError';
      }
    }

    module.exports = FileScannerError;
    ```

    ```javascript
    // Usage
    const FileScannerError = require('./errors/FileScannerError');

    if (!config.rootDir) {
      throw new FileScannerError('Missing "rootDir" in configuration.');
    }
    ```

=== Asynchronous Code

- **Promises and Async/Await**:
  - Use `async/await` for asynchronous operations to improve readability.
    ```javascript
    // Good
    async function fetchData() {
      try {
        const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
        const data = await response.json();
        return data;
      } catch (error) {
        logger.error(error);
        throw error;
      }
    }
    ```

- **Avoid Callback Hell**:
  - Prefer Promises over nested callbacks to manage asynchronous flows.
    ```javascript
    // Good
    function readAndProcessFile(file) {
      return readFile(file)
        .then(data => processData(data))
        .catch(error => logger.error(error));
    }
    ```

    ```javascript
    // Bad
    function readAndProcessFile(file, callback) {
      readFile(file, (err, data) => {
        if (err) return callback(err);
        processData(data, (err, result) => {
          if (err) return callback(err);
          callback(null, result);
        });
      });
    }
    ```

=== Code Reviews

- **Peer Reviews**:
  - All code must undergo peer review before merging.

- **Review Criteria**:
  - Code correctness, readability, adherence to standards, performance, and security.

== Documentation Standards

Comprehensive documentation is essential for understanding and maintaining the project.

=== Inline Documentation

- **Comments**:
  - Use comments to explain complex logic and decisions.
  - Avoid redundant comments that do not add value.
    ```javascript
    // Good
    // Calculate the factorial of a number using recursion
    function factorial(n) {
      if (n === 0) return 1;
      return n * factorial(n - 1);
    }

    // Bad
    // This function calculates factorial
    function factorial(n) {
      // If n is zero, return 1
      if (n === 0) return 1;
      // Otherwise, return n times factorial of n-1
      return n * factorial(n - 1);
    }
    ```

- **JSDoc**:
  - Use JSDoc annotations for functions, classes, and modules.
    ```javascript
    /**

    function example() {
      if (true) {
        console.log('Hello, World!');
      }
    }

    // Bad
    function example() {
        if (true) {
            console.log('Hello, World!');
        }
    }
    ```

- **Line Length**:
  - Limit lines to a maximum of 100 characters.

- **Semicolons**:
  - Use semicolons consistently to terminate statements.
    ```javascript
    // Good

    function test() { /* ... */ }

    // Bad
    const a = 5
    function test() { /* ... */ }
    ```

- **Quotes**:
  - Use single quotes `'` for strings unless double quotes `"` are necessary.
    ```javascript
    // Good
    const name = 'LLM-Pack';

    // Bad
    const name = "LLM-Pack";
    ```

- **Braces and Parentheses**:
  - Use braces `{}` for all control structures, even if the body contains a single statement.
    ```javascript
    // Good
    if (isValid) {
      execute();
    }

    // Bad
    if (isValid) execute();
    ```

- **Trailing Commas**:
  - Use trailing commas in multi-line object and array literals for easier diffs.
    ```javascript

= LLM-Pack Design Patterns
:sectnums:
:toc:

== Introduction

Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems. They provide a standardized approach to solving issues related to code organization, scalability, maintainability, and extensibility. This document outlines the **Design Patterns** adopted for the **LLM-Pack** project, explaining their applicability and implementation to ensure the development of a robust and efficient application.

== Overview of Design Patterns

Based on the requirements and architecture of LLM-Pack, the following design patterns have been selected:

1. **Singleton**
2. **Factory Method**
3. **Strategy**
4. **Observer**
5. **Command**
6. **Facade**
7. **Decorator**
8. **Adapter**
9. **Builder**

Each pattern is detailed in subsequent sections, explaining its intent, applicability to LLM-Pack, and implementation strategy.

== Design Patterns

=== Singleton Pattern

==== Intent

Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.

==== Applicability to LLM-Pack

- **Logger**: Centralized logging system to capture and manage logs consistently across the application.
- **Configuration Processor**: Manages configuration settings, ensuring a single source of truth.

==== Implementation in LLM-Pack

```javascript
// src/utils/logger.js
class Logger {
  constructor() {
    if (Logger.instance) {
      return Logger.instance;
    }
    this.logLevel = 'info';
    Logger.instance = this;
  }

  info(message) {
    if (this.logLevel === 'info') {
      console.log(`INFO: ${message}`);
    }
  }

  error(message) {
    console.error(`ERROR: ${message}`);
  }

  // Additional log levels and methods
}

module.exports = new Logger();
```

==== Benefits

- **Consistency**: Ensures all parts of the application use the same logging mechanism.
- **Resource Management**: Prevents multiple instances consuming unnecessary resources.

=== Factory Method Pattern

==== Intent

Define an interface for creating an object but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

==== Applicability to LLM-Pack

- **Module Initialization**: Creating instances of different processors (e.g., FileScanner, MetadataProcessor) based on configuration or context.
- **GUI Components**: Dynamically creating UI components based on user interactions.

==== Implementation in LLM-Pack

```javascript
// src/core/moduleFactory.js
const FileScanner = require('./fileScanner');
const MetadataProcessor = require('./metadataProcessor');
const Sorter = require('./sorter');

class ModuleFactory {
  static createModule(moduleType, config) {
    switch (moduleType) {
      case 'FileScanner':
        return new FileScanner(config);
      case 'MetadataProcessor':
        return new MetadataProcessor(config);
      case 'Sorter':
        return new Sorter(config);
      default:
        throw new Error(`Unknown module type: ${moduleType}`);
    }
  }
}

module.exports = ModuleFactory;
```

==== Benefits

- **Flexibility**: Easily extendable to include new modules without modifying existing code.
- **Decoupling**: Reduces dependencies between module creation and usage.

=== Strategy Pattern

==== Intent

Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

==== Applicability to LLM-Pack

- **Sorting Mechanism**: Allow different sorting algorithms to be used based on user preferences or data characteristics.
- **File Consolidation**: Enable various consolidation strategies for different file types or project structures.

==== Implementation in LLM-Pack

```javascript
// src/core/sorter.js
class Sorter {
  constructor(strategy) {
    this.strategy = strategy;
  }

  setStrategy(strategy) {
    this.strategy = strategy;
  }

  sort(files) {
    return this.strategy.sort(files);
  }
}

module.exports = Sorter;

// src/core/strategies/lexicalSort.js
class LexicalSort {
  sort(files) {
    return files.sort((a, b) => a.name.localeCompare(b.name));
  }
}

module.exports = LexicalSort;

// Usage
const Sorter = require('./sorter');
const LexicalSort = require('./strategies/lexicalSort');

const sorter = new Sorter(new LexicalSort());
const sortedFiles = sorter.sort(fileList);
```

==== Benefits

- **Extensibility**: Easily introduce new sorting algorithms without altering existing sorter logic.
- **Maintainability**: Encapsulates sorting logic, making it easier to manage and update.

=== Observer Pattern

==== Intent

Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

==== Applicability to LLM-Pack

- **Event Handling**: Manage events such as file scanning completion, error occurrences, or user actions in the GUI.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Notify logging systems of significant events for auditing and debugging.

==== Implementation in LLM-Pack

```javascript
// src/utils/eventEmitter.js
const EventEmitter = require('events');

class LLMEventEmitter extends EventEmitter {}

module.exports = new LLMEventEmitter();

// Usage in FileScanner
const eventEmitter = require('../utils/eventEmitter');

class FileScanner {
  async scan() {
    // Scanning logic
    eventEmitter.emit('scanComplete', scannedFiles);
  }
}

// Usage in Logger
const eventEmitter = require('../utils/eventEmitter');
const logger = require('./logger');

eventEmitter.on('scanComplete', (files) => {
  logger.info(`Scan completed with ${files.length} files.`);
});
```

==== Benefits

- **Decoupling**: Reduces direct dependencies between modules, enhancing modularity.
- **Scalability**: Easily add new observers to handle additional event types without modifying event emitters.

=== Command Pattern

==== Intent

Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with different requests, queueing or logging of requests, and supporting undoable operations.

==== Applicability to LLM-Pack

- **CLI Commands**: Represent different CLI actions (e.g., scan, consolidate) as command objects.
- **Undo/Redo Functionality**: (Future Enhancement) Allow users to revert actions within the GUI.

==== Implementation in LLM-Pack

```javascript
// src/cli/commands/command.js
class Command {
  execute() {}
}

module.exports = Command;

// src/cli/commands/scanCommand.js
const Command = require('./command');
const FileScanner = require('../../core/fileScanner');
const eventEmitter = require('../../utils/eventEmitter');

class ScanCommand extends Command {
  constructor(config) {
    super();
    this.config = config;
  }

  async execute() {
    const scanner = new FileScanner(this.config.rootDir);
    const files = await scanner.scan();
    eventEmitter.emit('scanComplete', files);
  }
}

module.exports = ScanCommand;

// Usage in CLI
const ScanCommand = require('./commands/scanCommand');

const scanCommand = new ScanCommand(config);
scanCommand.execute();
```

==== Benefits

- **Flexibility**: Easily add new commands without altering the CLI core logic.
- **Extensibility**: Supports complex command operations and future enhancements like undo/redo.

=== Facade Pattern

==== Intent

Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, making the subsystem easier to use.

==== Applicability to LLM-Pack

- **Simplified API Access**: Offer a simplified interface for interacting with core modules (e.g., scanning, consolidating).
- **GUI Integration**: Simplify interactions between GUI components and core processing logic.

==== Implementation in LLM-Pack

```javascript
// src/core/facade.js
const FileScanner = require('./fileScanner');
const MetadataProcessor = require('./metadataProcessor');
const Sorter = require('./sorter');
const Consolidator = require('./consolidator');

class LLMFacade {
  constructor(config) {
    this.fileScanner = new FileScanner(config.rootDir);
    this.metadataProcessor = new MetadataProcessor();
    this.sorter = new Sorter();
    this.consolidator = new Consolidator();
  }

  async processProject() {
    const files = await this.fileScanner.scan();
    const enrichedFiles = await this.metadataProcessor.enrich(files);
    const sortedFiles = this.sorter.sort(enrichedFiles);
    const consolidated = await this.consolidator.consolidate(sortedFiles);
    return consolidated;
  }
}

module.exports = LLMFacade;

// Usage in CLI or GUI
const LLMFacade = require('./facade');
const facade = new LLMFacade(config);
const result = await facade.processProject();
```

==== Benefits

- **Ease of Use**: Provides a simple interface for complex operations.
- **Reduced Complexity**: Hides the intricacies of subsystem interactions from the client.

=== Decorator Pattern

==== Intent

Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

==== Applicability to LLM-Pack

- **File Processing Enhancements**: Add functionalities such as encryption, compression, or metadata enrichment without modifying core file processing classes.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Dynamically add logging capabilities to existing modules.

==== Implementation in LLM-Pack

```javascript
// src/core/decorators/encryptedFileProcessor.js
const FileProcessor = require('../fileProcessor');
const crypto = require('crypto');

class EncryptedFileProcessor extends FileProcessor {
  constructor(fileProcessor, encryptionKey) {
    super();
    this.fileProcessor = fileProcessor;
    this.encryptionKey = encryptionKey;
  }

  async process(file) {
    const data = await this.fileProcessor.process(file);
    return this.encrypt(data);
  }

  encrypt(data) {
    const cipher = crypto.createCipher('aes-256-cbc', this.encryptionKey);
    let encrypted = cipher.update(data, 'utf8', 'hex');
    encrypted += cipher.final('hex');
    return encrypted;
  }
}

module.exports = EncryptedFileProcessor;

// Usage
const FileProcessor = require('../core/fileProcessor');
const EncryptedFileProcessor = require('./decorators/encryptedFileProcessor');

const processor = new EncryptedFileProcessor(new FileProcessor(), 'secretKey');
const encryptedData = await processor.process(file);
```

==== Benefits

- **Flexibility**: Easily add or remove functionalities at runtime.
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Allows classes to be open for extension but closed for modification.

=== Adapter Pattern

==== Intent

Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn’t otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

==== Applicability to LLM-Pack

- **Third-Party Integrations**: Integrate with external APIs or libraries that have different interfaces.
- **Legacy Code Support**: Adapt existing modules to work with new interfaces without significant rewrites.

==== Implementation in LLM-Pack

```javascript
// src/core/adapters/githubAdapter.js
const GitHubAPI = require('github-api');

class GitHubAdapter {
  constructor(token) {
    this.github = new GitHubAPI({ token });
  }

  async getRepoFiles(repoName) {
    const repo = this.github.getRepo('owner', repoName);
    const contents = await repo.getContents('master', '/');
    return contents.data.map(file => file.path);
  }
}

module.exports = GitHubAdapter;

// Usage in Core Processing
const GitHubAdapter = require('./adapters/githubAdapter');
const adapter = new GitHubAdapter(process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN);
const files = await adapter.getRepoFiles('llm-pack-repo');
```

==== Benefits

- **Compatibility**: Enables integration with disparate systems.
- **Reusability**: Allows existing classes to be reused with new interfaces.

=== Builder Pattern

==== Intent

Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

==== Applicability to LLM-Pack

- **Configuration Objects**: Build complex configuration objects for different modules or environments.
- **Output Reports**: Generate different types of reports (e.g., Markdown, HTML) using the same construction process.

==== Implementation in LLM-Pack

```javascript
// src/utils/configBuilder.js
class ConfigBuilder {
  constructor() {
    this.config = {};
  }

  setRootDir(rootDir) {
    this.config.rootDir = rootDir;
    return this;
  }

  setIgnoreFiles(ignoreFiles) {
    this.config.ignoreFiles = ignoreFiles;
    return this;
  }

  setMetadataOptions(options) {
    this.config.metadataOptions = options;
    return this;
  }

  build() {
    return this.config;
  }
}

module.exports = ConfigBuilder;

// Usage
const ConfigBuilder = require('../utils/configBuilder');

const config = new ConfigBuilder()
  .setRootDir('/projects/llm-pack')
  .setIgnoreFiles(['.gitignore', '.llm-pack.ignore'])
  .setMetadataOptions({ enrichDescriptions: true })
  .build();
```

==== Benefits

- **Clarity**: Provides a clear and fluent interface for object creation.
- **Immutability**: Can enforce immutability of constructed objects by avoiding setters after build.
