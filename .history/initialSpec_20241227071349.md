= SPEC: LLM-Pack
:sectnums:
:toc:

== Background

As developers and LLM users increasingly rely on generative AI tools to assist in development, creating concise, comprehensive, and contextually rich data inputs becomes critical. Many large language models (LLMs) operate in environments where users cannot upload large datasets or numerous files directly. Instead, users must copy and paste relevant content manually, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and often results in loss of critical context.

LLM-Pack is a CLI tool, with an optional GUI launched from the CLI, designed to address this challenge. It optimizes project files and datasets for consumption by LLMs and humans alike. By consolidating content into a single, labeled, and sorted file with metadata and interconnectivity details, LLM-Pack streamlines workflows, enhances LLM responses, and saves time for developers.

The tool respects existing project structure by adhering to ignore files, applies user-configured settings via `.llm-pack.config.json`, and outputs a `.llm-pack` folder with generated files and configurations. Its API-first design ensures high extendability and integrability across various platforms, fostering a robust ecosystem around the tool.

== Requirements

The LLM-Pack application must meet the following requirements to address the identified user needs effectively:

=== Must-Have

- **Recursive Indexing**: The tool must scan the entire project/dataset folder structure recursively, identifying all files and folders.
- **Ignore File Compliance**: Respect ignore files (`.gitignore`, `.llm-pack.ignore`, etc.) in the root or child directories during indexing.
- **File Consolidation**: Combine all non-ignored files into a single output file with:
  - Stylized headers containing file name, relative path, and metadata.
  - Relevant interconnectivity details for LLM optimization.
- **Sorting Mechanism**: Sort files in a manner optimized for both LLMs and humans.
- **Config File Support**: Parse `.llm-pack.config.json` files to customize the behavior and settings of the tool.
- **.llm-pack Folder Generation**: Output the consolidated file and associated configurations to the `.llm-pack` folder in the root directory.
- **CLI with Optional GUI**: Provide a command-line interface with an optional GUI for ease of use.
- **Extendable API**: Include a comprehensive API that allows easy integration with other systems or applications.

=== Should-Have

- **Metadata Enrichment**: Automatically generate additional metadata for files, such as descriptions or relationships, where applicable.
- **Interactive Mode**: Offer an interactive CLI mode for advanced configuration during execution.
- **Error Handling and Reporting**: Include robust error detection, logging, and user-friendly reporting.

=== Could-Have

- **Content Analysis**: Analyze file content for additional sorting and organization strategies (e.g., detecting similar themes or topics).
- **Language Agnostic**: Ensure compatibility with any file or folder structure regardless of content type or language.
- **GUI Customizations**: Allow GUI users to modify settings visually before execution.

=== Won’t-Have (for MVP)

- **Cloud Integration**: Direct integration with cloud services (e.g., S3, GDrive) is deferred for future versions.
- **Real-Time Syncing**: Automatic syncing with external datasets or repositories is out of scope for the initial implementation.
- **Workers and Web Workers**: Worker threads, including Web Workers for concurrency, will not be supported in the MVP version.

== Method

The architecture of LLM-Pack is designed to be modular, scalable, and extendable, with clear separation of concerns between its core functionalities. The following sections outline the major components and their interactions.

=== High-Level Architecture

The application consists of the following layers:
1. **CLI and GUI Layer**: Provides user interaction and configuration.
2. **Core Processing Layer**: Handles file scanning, ignore file compliance, metadata enrichment, and consolidation logic.
3. **API Layer**: Exposes extendable functionality for integrations.
4. **Output Layer**: Generates the `.llm-pack` folder and consolidated file.

Below is a high-level diagram of the architecture:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User
User -> CLI : Interacts via CLI commands
User -> GUI : Interacts via optional GUI

CLI -> CoreProcessing : Passes commands and configurations
GUI -> CoreProcessing : Passes configurations

CoreProcessing -> FileScanner : Scans directories recursively
CoreProcessing -> IgnoreProcessor : Filters files using ignore rules
CoreProcessing -> MetadataProcessor : Enriches files with metadata
CoreProcessing -> Sorter : Sorts files for LLM and human consumption
CoreProcessing -> Consolidator : Combines files into a single document

CoreProcessing -> API : Exposes extendable methods
CoreProcessing -> OutputManager : Writes to `.llm-pack` folder
@enduml
```

=== Key Modules

1. **File Scanner**
   - Recursively scans the root directory and subdirectories.
   - Gathers all file paths and metadata for processing.
   - Supports multithreaded scanning for performance optimization.

2. **Ignore Processor**
   - Parses `.gitignore`, `.llm-pack.ignore`, and other ignore files.
   - Filters out files and folders based on ignore rules.

3. **Metadata Processor**
   - Enriches each file with:
     - Relative path from the root.
     - Stylized headers with file names.
     - Interconnectivity details based on file relationships (e.g., imports, references).

4. **Sorter**
   - Implements sorting logic to arrange files in a meaningful order for both humans and LLMs.

5. **Consolidator**
   - Reads content from each file.
   - Applies stylized headers and integrates metadata.
   - Outputs a single file in **Markdown format** containing consolidated data.

6. **Config Processor**
   - Parses `.llm-pack.config.json` to customize application behavior.
   - Allows users to override default sorting, metadata, or file-processing rules.

7. **API**
   - Offers programmatic access to file indexing, metadata enrichment, and consolidation.
   - Supports integrations with external systems.

8. **GUI**
   - A lightweight interface launched from the CLI.
   - Provides visual customization of settings and triggers CLI commands.

=== File Structure

- **Input**: The tool expects to be run in the root directory of the project or dataset.
- **Output**: All results are stored in a `.llm-pack` folder with the following structure:
  ```
  .llm-pack/
  ├── consolidated_output.md    # Single consolidated Markdown file
  ├── config.json               # Copy of .llm-pack.config.json with defaults
  └── logs/                     # Logs for error handling and debugging
  ```

=== Algorithms

1. **Recursive File Scanning Algorithm**
   - Traverse directories using a Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS).
   - Skip ignored files and directories during traversal.

2. **File Consolidation Algorithm**
   - For each non-ignored file:
     1. Add a stylized header containing metadata.
     2. Append file content below the header in Markdown format.
   - Sort the files based on LLM optimization logic.

3. **Metadata Enrichment Logic**
   - Extract relationships using simple heuristics (e.g., `import` statements, file references).
