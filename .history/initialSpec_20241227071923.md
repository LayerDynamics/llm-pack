= SPEC: LLM-Pack
:sectnums:
:toc:

== Background

As developers and LLM users increasingly rely on generative AI tools to assist in development, creating concise, comprehensive, and contextually rich data inputs becomes critical. Many large language models (LLMs) operate in environments where users cannot upload large datasets or numerous files directly. Instead, users must copy and paste relevant content manually, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and often results in loss of critical context.

LLM-Pack is a CLI tool, with an optional GUI launched from the CLI, designed to address this challenge. It optimizes project files and datasets for consumption by LLMs and humans alike. By consolidating content into a single, labeled, and sorted file with metadata and interconnectivity details, LLM-Pack streamlines workflows, enhances LLM responses, and saves time for developers.

The tool respects existing project structure by adhering to ignore files, applies user-configured settings via `.llm-pack.config.json`, and outputs a `.llm-pack` folder with generated files and configurations. Its API-first design ensures high extendability and integrability across various platforms, fostering a robust ecosystem around the tool.

== Requirements

The LLM-Pack application must meet the following requirements to address the identified user needs effectively:

=== Must-Have

- **Recursive Indexing**: The tool must scan the entire project/dataset folder structure recursively, identifying all files and folders.
- **Ignore File Compliance**: Respect ignore files (`.gitignore`, `.llm-pack.ignore`, etc.) in the root or child directories during indexing.
- **File Consolidation**: Combine all non-ignored files into a single output file with:
  - Stylized headers containing file name, relative path, and metadata.
  - Relevant interconnectivity details for LLM optimization.
- **Sorting Mechanism**: Sort files in a manner optimized for both LLMs and humans.
- **Config File Support**: Parse `.llm-pack.config.json` files to customize the behavior and settings of the tool.
- **.llm-pack Folder Generation**: Output the consolidated file and associated configurations to the `.llm-pack` folder in the root directory.
- **CLI with Optional GUI**: Provide a command-line interface with an optional GUI for ease of use.
- **Extendable API**: Include a comprehensive API that allows easy integration with other systems or applications.
- **Security Compliance**: Ensure that sensitive data is handled securely and that the tool does not expose or leak confidential information.
- **Performance Efficiency**: Optimize the tool to handle large projects with minimal memory and CPU usage.

=== Should-Have

- **Metadata Enrichment**: Automatically generate additional metadata for files, such as descriptions or relationships, where applicable.
- **Interactive Mode**: Offer an interactive CLI mode for advanced configuration during execution.
- **Error Handling and Reporting**: Include robust error detection, logging, and user-friendly reporting.
- **Internationalization (i18n)**: Support multiple languages for the GUI and CLI to cater to a global user base.

=== Could-Have

- **Content Analysis**: Analyze file content for additional sorting and organization strategies (e.g., detecting similar themes or topics).
- **Language Agnostic**: Ensure compatibility with any file or folder structure regardless of content type or language.
- **GUI Customizations**: Allow GUI users to modify settings visually before execution.
- **Plugin System**: Enable third-party plugins to extend the functionality of LLM-Pack.

=== Won’t-Have (for MVP)

- **Cloud Integration**: Direct integration with cloud services (e.g., S3, GDrive) is deferred for future versions.
- **Real-Time Syncing**: Automatic syncing with external datasets or repositories is out of scope for the initial implementation.
- **Workers and Web Workers**: Worker threads, including Web Workers for concurrency, will not be supported in the MVP version.

== Method

The architecture of LLM-Pack is designed to be modular, scalable, and extendable, with clear separation of concerns between its core functionalities. The following sections outline the major components and their interactions.

=== File Structure

- **Input**: The tool expects to be run in the root directory of the project or dataset.
- **Output**: All results are stored in a `.llm-pack` folder with the following structure:
  ```
  .llm-pack/
  ├── consolidated_output.md    # Single consolidated Markdown file
  ├── config.json               # Copy of .llm-pack.config.json with defaults
  ├── logs/                     # Logs for error handling and debugging
  │   ├── error.log
  │   └── access.log
  └── reports/                  # Reports on processing and performance
      └── summary_report.md
  ```

=== Algorithms

1. **Recursive File Scanning Algorithm**
   - Traverse directories using a Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS).
   - Skip ignored files and directories during traversal.

2. **File Consolidation Algorithm**
   - For each non-ignored file:
     1. Add a stylized header containing metadata.
     2. Append file content below the header in Markdown format.
   - Sort the files based on LLM optimization logic.

3. **Metadata Enrichment Logic**
   - Extract relationships using simple heuristics (e.g., `import` statements, file references).

=== Security Considerations

Ensuring the security and privacy of data processed by LLM-Pack is paramount. The following measures are implemented:

- **Data Privacy**: The tool does not transmit any data externally. All processing occurs locally on the user's machine.
- **Sensitive Data Handling**: Implements encryption for any sensitive metadata or content included in the consolidated output.
- **Access Controls**: Restricts access to the `.llm-pack` folder to authorized users only.
- **Dependency Security**: Regularly scans and updates dependencies to mitigate vulnerabilities using tools like `npm audit`.

=== Performance Considerations

LLM-Pack is optimized to handle large projects efficiently. Key performance strategies include:

- **Multithreading**: Utilizes multithreading in the File Scanner to expedite directory traversal.
- **Efficient I/O Operations**: Implements buffered I/O to reduce read/write times during file consolidation.
- **Memory Management**: Employs streaming techniques to handle large files without excessive memory consumption.
- **Benchmarking**: Establishes performance benchmarks to ensure processing times remain within acceptable limits.

=== Dependency Management

Effective dependency management ensures the stability and security of LLM-Pack. Strategies include:

- **Version Pinning**: Specifies exact versions of dependencies in `package.json` to prevent unexpected updates.
- **Regular Updates**: Periodically updates dependencies to incorporate security patches and feature enhancements.
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Integrates tools like `npm audit` to detect and address vulnerabilities.
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Keeps the dependency list minimal to reduce potential security risks and maintenance overhead.

=== Licensing

LLM-Pack will be released under the **MIT License**, providing users with flexibility while protecting the project's integrity. The `LICENSE` file in the project root will contain the full license text.

== Implementation

This section provides a step-by-step implementation plan for LLM-Pack, including a comprehensive project file list.

=== Steps to Build

1. **Setup Project Structure**
   - Initialize the project with a directory structure for core modules, configuration, and output.
   - Use Node.js as the primary backend with ES modules (ECMAScript) for better modularity.

2. **Develop Core Modules**
   - Build each module incrementally, starting with FileScanner and IgnoreProcessor.
   - Implement the Security Module to handle data protection from the outset.
